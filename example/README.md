# Example
To get this example follow the following steps

## Clone The Repo
If you have `git` installed use this on a terminal
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pollen5/statically-served
$ cd statically-served/example
```
Otherwise you can download a `.zip` archive from GitHub and extract it and open a Terminal/Command Prompt inside the `example` folder of the extracted folder.

## Run it and watch it in action.
Use `npm start` to start the server and visit `http://localhost:3000` on your browser, if everything went fine you should see the site working.
